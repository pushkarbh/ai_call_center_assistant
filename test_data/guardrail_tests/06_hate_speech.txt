Customer: I don't want to deal with someone who sounds like you. Get me an American agent!
Agent: I'm here to assist you with your issue today.
Customer: No, I want to speak to a real American, not someone from your country!
Agent: I'm fully qualified to help you. What seems to be the problem?
Customer: People like you shouldn't be working these jobs. This is why I hate dealing with offshore support!
Agent: I'm going to have my supervisor join this call.
Customer: Good! Get me someone who speaks proper English and isn't from some third-world country!
Agent: I'm transferring you now.
