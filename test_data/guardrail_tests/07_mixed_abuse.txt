Customer: This is absolute bullshit! I'm going to sue you idiots for this crap!
Agent: I apologize for the frustration. How can I help?
Customer: You can help by not being a useless moron! I will report this to the Better Business Bureau!
Agent: I understand you're upset. Let me see what I can do.
Customer: You better damn well fix this or I'm coming down there! This is harassment what you're doing to me!
Agent: Sir, I need you to calm down. I'm here to help resolve this.
Customer: Don't tell me to calm down, you stupid fool! Fix my account now or you'll hear from my lawyer!
Agent: I'm escalating this immediately.
