Customer: I need to speak with someone competent, not some idiot like you!
Agent: I'm sorry you're frustrated. I'm here to help.
Customer: You're useless! Are you even qualified for this job? You sound incompetent!
Agent: I understand you're upset. Let me transfer you to my supervisor.
Customer: Yes, please get me someone with a brain! You're clearly too stupid to help me!
Agent: I'm connecting you now. Please hold.
Customer: Finally! Get me away from this moron!
