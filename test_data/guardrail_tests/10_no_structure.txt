Hi I'm calling about my bill but I don't really know what the problem is I just saw some charges that seemed weird but maybe they're okay I'm not sure I should probably check my statements more carefully but I didn't so now I'm calling and I hope you can help me figure out what's going on with these charges that I saw on my statement last week or maybe it was two weeks ago I can't remember exactly when it was but anyway I noticed there were some amounts that didn't look familiar to me so I thought I should call and ask about them even though I'm not completely sure what I'm asking about really I just want to understand my bill better and make sure everything is correct because I don't want to pay for things I didn't order or use but I might have ordered them I just don't remember so can you help me look into this issue that I'm having with my billing statement.
