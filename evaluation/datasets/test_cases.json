I can see that you were upgraded to the Premium plan last month, which is $99 per month.\n\nCustomer: Oh, I didn't authorize that upgrade.\n\nAgent: I apologize for the confusion. I can see it was an automatic upgrade. I'll reverse that and credit you the $20 difference. Is there anything else I can help with?\n\nCustomer: No, that's perfect.

Let me check the status of your service tickets.\n\nCustomer: I work from home and this is costing me money. I need this fixed today.\n\nAgent: I completely understand the urgency. I can see multiple tickets here. Unfortunately, this requires a technician visit. The earliest available slot is tomorrow between 9 AM and 12 PM. However, given the extended outage, I'm going to escalate this to our priority team.\n\nCustomer: Tomorrow is still not acceptable, but I guess it's better than nothing.\n\nAgent: I'll also apply a service credit for the days you've been without service.

Now, regarding the app crashing - what device are you using?\n\nCustomer: iPhone 14.\n\nAgent: Please try deleting and reinstalling the app. If that doesn't work, call us back. Finally, for the rewards card - I see it was mailed on January 10th. It should arrive within 7-10 business days.
